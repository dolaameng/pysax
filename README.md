# pysax
python implementation of SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) for time series data

## Idea
1. Convert time series data into symbolic representation, where the (Euclidean) distance/similarity is lower bound by the distance in the symbolic space
2. The symbolic representation can be viewed as a low-dim (aggregate) representation of time series
3. Symbol based algorithms such as suffix-tree, markov chain can be used to analyze time-series

## Why are we re-implementing it?
1. SAX has certain assumptions on time-series data, such as (1) local Gaussian, (2) fixed frequence, (3) real-valued signals. We want to explore more possiblities for other data
2. We want a vector representation of time-series pieces, similiar to the idea of representing words a vectors (Google's word2vec)
3. we need a fast parallel implementation

# python wrapper for sequitur

## Idea
1. sequitur will be used as the context-free grammar extractor for SAXed data
2. the mined rules will be used for outlier/motif detection 
3. we wrap the [c++ implementation](http://sequitur.info/latest/sequitur.tgz) for python usage - so it is just a quick workaround for now.

4. [java implementation](https://github.com/GrammarViz2/grammarviz2_src) can be found in grammarviz2 implementation

## how to use the wrapper
1. download c++ code http://sequitur.info/latest/sequitur.tgz
2. put the `sequitur` code from the uncompressed folder in a convienet place
3. use the pysequitur package and pass the path to `sequitur` as constructor parameter

## why do we wrap it?
1. to make it easier to use with pysax
2. we understand that the c++ implementation treats rule terminals as single characters, whereas in pysax we are dealing with words, so we need to map the words to single characters first - this might change in future based on our understanding of the code.

# grammar-based outlier detection

## Idea
1. to implement the idea based on [Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression](file:///home/chenlin/Downloads/14-05.pdf) - using grammar analysis for time series outlier detection
2. main steps:
	a. SAX-symbolize the time series
	b. numerosity reduction
	c. grammar induction by sequitur
	d. map rules to subsequences
	e. mine the patten
